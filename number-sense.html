    <h1>Number Sense</h1>
    <h3>Order of Operations</h3>
    <p>"Operations" mean things like add, subtract, multiply, divide, squaring, etc. If it isn't a number it is probably an operation. But when you have an equation with numerous different operations,what should you do? Start from right to left? Left to right? Warning: Calculate them in the wrong order, and you can get a wrong answer! This is why mathematicians developed PEDMAS ts an order to follow when doing calculations.</p>
    <p>Move from left to right while following the rules. Do things in parentheses first. Anything within brackets takes priority, and brackets within brackets take even higher priority. Exponents then come next. This include not only powers, but roots as well. Following that is any operations that include division and multiplication. Finally, do all the additions and subtraction to finish your calculations.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Use PEDMAS to solve the following equations.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) (5 + 6) x 8</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 2 x (6 / 3 + 9) - 10</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 3^2 + 5 x (7 + (4 - 1)) (^ means to the power of)</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 88</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 12</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 59</i></p>

    <h3>Fractions</h3>
    <p>Imagine you have a pizza. If you slice it up, we get fractions. The top number of a fraction tells us how many slices we have while the bottom number tells us how many slices the whole pizza was cut into.</p>
    <p>Some fractions may look different, but are actually still the same value. If you have 4 slices of a pizza cut into 8 pieces, that's the same as having 2 slices of a pizza cut into 4 pieces or 1 slice of pizza cut into 2.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Determine if the fractions below are equal to each other or not.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 4/5 and 8/12</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 3/7 and 9/21</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 2/6 and 4/12 and 1/3</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) No</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Yes</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Yes</i></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Decimals</h3>
    <p>A Decimal Number (based on the number 10) contains a decimal point. For decimals, it's all about the point value. In the number 327: the "7" is in the Ones position, meaning 7 ones, the "2" is in the Tens position meaning 2 tens, and the "3" is in the Hundreds position, meaning 3 hundreds. As we move right, the number gets bigger and vice versa. If we move to the left though and get smaller than a one, then we must use a decimal point to determine the value of the number.</p>
    <p>Be wary though, just because a value has more numbers in it now doesn't mean it's going to be bigger all the time anymore. Depending on where the decimal point is, the number could be tiny or massive. With just the power of a single dot.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Determine which of the decimals below are larger.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 0.4 and 0.376</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 1.221 and 0.99</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 0.33333333333 and 0.34</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Left</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Left</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Right</i></p>

    <h3>Rational/Irrational Numbers</h3>
    <p>A rational number can be created with the division of two integers, also known as a fraction. Some examples include 5, 1.5, .001, and 0.11... because they can all be represented by a fraction (5/1, 3/2, 1/1000, 1/9).</p>
    <p>However, not all numbers are rational. The square root of 2 is a good example as it cannot be represented by the division of two integers.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Determine is the numbers below are rational or irrational.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 1.234</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Ï€</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Square root of 169</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Rational, 617/500</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Irrational, 3.14159265...</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Rational, 13 (Not all square roots are irrational!)</i></p>
