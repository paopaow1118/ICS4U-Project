  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p style = "color:#0B4917">At Accessible Algebra, our main priority is to provide resources and help bridge the social class gap between social classes. We seek equal treatment for all students and wish to provide them all with opprotunities for improvement. Currently we specialize in providing math services for kids in grades 6-8, but will expand our curriculum in the future.
  <br>
  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <p style = "color:#0B4917">We are a group of Grade 12 students who created this website for our computer science project. Here is a brief introduction from all of us!</p>
