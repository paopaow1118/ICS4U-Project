    <h3>Probability</h3>
    <p>Many events can't be predicted with total certainty. The best we can say is how likely they are to happen, using the idea of probability. For example, when a coin is tossed there are 2 possibilities. The coin either lands on heads or it lands on tails. This, we can say the probability of the coin landing on either side is 1/2. Continuing on, when a die is thrown the probability of it landing on a certain side is 1/6. In general, the probability of an event happening is equal to the number of ways it can happen divided by the number of toal outcomes.</p>
    <p>This form of probability does not tell us what will happen, it only acts as a guide. This is known as theoretical probability, where math is used to determine the likelihood of an event happening. This is seperate from experimental probability, where data is recorded and is used to find the probabilty of the event happening based on actual trials.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Answer the probabilty questions below.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Each letter of the word "school" is written down individually on a piece of paper and put into a bag where you pick one out. What is the chances that you will pick an "o"?</i></p>
    <p><i>2) A coin is flipped 100 times. It landed on head 39 times. What is the experimental probability of the coin landing on tails?</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: A die is thrown twice. What is the probability of rolling the same number both times?</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 1/3</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 61/100</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 1/6</i></p>

    <h3>Mean, Median and Mode</h3>
    <p>Mean, median, and mode are three kinds of "averages". There are many "averages" in statistics, but these are, I think, the three most common, and are certainly the three you are most likely to encounter in your pre-statistics courses, if the topic comes up at all.</p>
    <p>The "mean" is the "average" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The "median" is the "middle" value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order from smallest to largest, so you may have to rewrite your list before you can find the median. The "mode" is the value that occurs most often. If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Find the mean, median and mode of each of the data sets below.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 1, 3, 5, 7, 9</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 2, 3, 4, 7, 7, 9, 10</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 84, 93, 4, 42, 53, 106, 31</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>2) Mean = 5, Median = 5, Mode = N/A</i></p>
    <p><i>1) Mean = 6, Median = 7, Mode = 7</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Mean = 59, Median = 53, Mode = N/A</i></p>

    <h3>Tables and Graphs</h3>
    <p>Tables and graphs are visual representations. They are used to organise information to show patterns and relationships. A graph shows this information by representing it as a shape. Researchers and scientists often use tables and graphs to report findings from their research. In newspapers, magazine articles, and on television they are often used to support an argument or point of view. </p>
    <p>There are many types of graphs and each accomplishes a specific task. Bar and pie graphs are used to show relative sizes of categories, line graphs show changing information over time, scatterplots connect two pieces of data together based on correlation and et cetera.</p>
    <p><b>Example: What type of graph should be used to show data for each of the scenarios below?</b></p>
    <p><i>1) You conducted a survey in your class about what movie was everyone's favourite out of a small selection and want to compare the results. </i></p>
    <p><i>2) You're growing a plant and measuring its height each day, keeping track of its progress.</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: You're comparing two variables, the price of homes and the amount of land it comes with. You want to see if there's a correlation between them.</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Pie/Bar Graph</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Line Graph</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Scatterplot</i></p>
