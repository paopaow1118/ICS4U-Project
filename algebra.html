    <h1>Algebra</h1>
    <h3>Identifying Patterns</h3>
    <p>A pattern is a series or sequence that repeats.
    You can observe patterns - things like colors, shapes, actions, or other sequences that repeat - everywhere. Think about words or melodies in songs, lines and curves on buildings, or even in the grocery store where boxes and jars of various items are lined up.</p>
    <p>But, one of the most common places to find patterns is in math. Math patterns are sequences that repeat according to a rule or rules. In math, a rule is a set way to calculate or solve a problem.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Identify the patterns below and determine how they're created.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 19, 16, 17, 14, 15, 12, 11, 8, 9</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 42</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Start from 3, increase by 2 each time.</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Start from 19, decrease by 3 and increase by 1 each time.</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Add the current and previous terms together to form the next term. This is also known as the Fibonacci sequence.</i></p>

    <h3>Solving Equations with Variables</h3>
    <p>What is the missing number?</p> 
    <p>x −	2	=	4</p>
    <p>OK, the answer is 6, right? Because 6 − 2 = 4. Easy stuff.</p>
    <p>It is really that simple. The letter (in this case an x) just means "we don't know this yet", and is often called the unknown or the variable.</p>
    <p>Algebra is just like a puzzle where we start with something like "x − 2 = 4" and we want to end up with something like "x = 6".</p>
    <p>But instead of saying "obviously x = 6", use this neat step-by-step approach:</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Work out what to remove to get "x = ..."</li>
    <li>Remove it by doing the opposite</li>
    <li>Do that to both sides</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Example: Solve for x in the following algebraic equations.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) 7 + x = 18</i></p>
    <p><i>2) 3x = 42</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: 2x - 5 = 27</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) x = 11 (7 + 11 = 18)</i></p>
    <p><i>2) x = 14 (3 x 14 = 42)</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: x = 16 (2 x 16 - 5 = 27)</i></p>
