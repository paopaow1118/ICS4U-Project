# ICS4U-Project

# This is my group's submission for our ICS4U project. Our objective as a team is to create a website that distributes free video and written math lessons for grades 6-8. We want to ensure that all kids receive equal levels of learning amongst public education. We aim to have high quality lessons that will help students have a deep understanding of the topics.
