  <h3>Transformations of Objects</h3>
    <p>There are three kinds of isometric transformations of 2 -dimensional shapes: translations, rotations, and reflections. ( Isometric means that the transformation doesn't change the size or shape of the figure.) A translation is the sliding of a figure, rotation sets one point of the figure as the centre and rotates around it, and reflection reflects the figure across a line on the plane.</p>
    <p>An important thing to note is that after any of those transformations (turn, flip or slide) are done, the shape still has the same size, area, angles and line lengths. This means the shape is still congruent to before it went through the transformation.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Watch the video and state which transformation is being shown.</b></p>
    <video width="400" height="auto" controls>

    <h3>Perimeter, Area and the Pythagorean Theorem</h3>
    <p>Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape. To find the perimeter of a shape, we measure and add all of the shape's side lengths. This can be done for all regular and irregular shapes apart from circles. For circles, a special formula is required to find its perimeter, also known as the circumference, 2 x π x r where r is the radius (distance from the centre to the edge)of the dircle. </p>
    <p>Area is the space inside of a two-dimensional shape. We can also think of area as the amount of space a shape covers. To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length of the rectangle by the width of the rectangle. A triangle can be represented by its base x height / 2. A circle is π x r^2, to name some examples. All regular shapes have their own formulas for calculating area.</p>
    <p>In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras's theorem is a statement about the sides of a right triangle. One of the angles of a right triangle is always equal to 90 degrees. This angle is the right angle. The two sides next to the right angle are called the legs and the other side is called the hypotenuse. If the lengths of the legs are a and b, and the length of the hypotenuse is c, then, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.</p>
    <p><b>Example: Find the perimeter and area of the shapes given the followng information.</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Rectangle: Length = 6, Width = 4</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Triangle: Base = 8, Height = 3</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Circle: Circumference = 9π</i></p>
    <p><b>Answers</b></p>
    <p><i>1) Perimeter = 20, Area = 24</i></p>
    <p><i>2) Perimeter = 18, Area = 12</i></p>
    <p><i>Bonus: Perimeter = 9π, Area = 6π</i></p>
